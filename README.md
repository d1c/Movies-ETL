# Movies ETL Project

## Project Overview

This project uses data from Wikipedia and Kaggle to learn the Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) process. Python and regular expressions (regex) are used to Extract and Transform the data. Python and PostgreSQL are used to Load the data into a database. The end result is a table with combined data from Wikipedia and Kaggle.
